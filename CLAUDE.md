# Mizan — Project Brain

## What Is This
Turkish personal finance behavioral coaching app. Users upload bank statements (PDF/CSV).
AI extracts transactions, categorizes them, finds behavioral patterns, coaches users on
WHY they overspend — not just what they spent. "Mizan" = balance/equilibrium in Turkish.

## Target User
Turkish individual. Has a bank account. Uploads PDF statements. Wants to understand
spending psychology, not just see pie charts. Probably frustrated that every finance app
just shows graphs without insight.

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Why | Alternative | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| Docker Compose for dev | All 3 services (DB, backend, frontend) start with one command; no "works on my machine" | Run each process locally | Local setup requires PostgreSQL, Node, Python all installed and configured |
| FastAPI over Django | Async-native, OpenAPI docs auto-generated, Pydantic validation baked in | Django + DRF | Django has ORM migrations that are more mature; FastAPI migrations need Alembic separately |
| Next.js App Router | Server components, file-based routing, built-in image optimization | Create React App / Vite | App Router has steeper learning curve; "use client" boundary must be managed manually |
| SQLAlchemy 2.0 async | Full async support; same ORM for sync and async code | Raw asyncpg queries | SQLAlchemy abstracts DB-specific SQL; raw queries are faster but not portable |
| Provider abstraction for LLM | Swap DeepSeek ↔ OpenAI by changing one env var; no code changes | Direct openai.ChatCompletion calls everywhere | One extra layer of indirection; adds ~30 lines of code |
| PostgreSQL over SQLite | Concurrent connections, JSON columns, full-text search — needed for production | SQLite | SQLite is zero-config but single-writer; can't scale beyond one process |

---

## Tech Stack

| Tool | Why Chosen | What It Replaces |
|---|---|---|
| Python 3.12 | Latest stable, free-threading preview, better type inference | Python 3.10/3.11 |
| FastAPI 0.115 | Async-first, Pydantic v2 native, best OpenAPI support | Flask, Django |
| Pydantic-settings | Reads .env + env vars + type-validates in one class | python-dotenv alone |
| SQLAlchemy 2.0 | Async sessions, 2.0 style is cleaner than legacy 1.x | SQLAlchemy 1.4, raw SQL |
| asyncpg | Fastest PostgreSQL async driver for Python | psycopg2 (sync only) |
| pdfplumber | Best Python library for extracting tables from PDF bank statements | PyPDF2, pdfminer |
| Next.js 14 | App Router, Server Components, built-in Tailwind support | CRA, Vite + React |
| Tailwind CSS 3.4 | Utility-first — no CSS files to maintain, consistent design tokens | CSS Modules, styled-components |
| DeepSeek V3 | ~10x cheaper than GPT-4o for high-volume transaction categorization | GPT-4o |
| GPT-4o-mini | Reliable fallback, widely available API key | GPT-3.5-turbo (deprecated) |
| Docker Compose | One-command local dev environment, mirrors production topology | Manual process management |
| PostgreSQL 16 | JSON columns, parallel query, row-level security for future multi-tenancy | MySQL, SQLite |

## LLM Strategy

**Primary: DeepSeek V3** (`deepseek-chat` via `https://api.deepseek.com`)
- Cost: ~$0.0014 per 1M input tokens vs GPT-4o at $2.50 — 1785x cheaper
- Quality: Comparable to GPT-4o on categorization and structured output tasks
- SDK: Uses openai Python SDK with `base_url` override — DeepSeek is OpenAI API-compatible
- Risk: Newer provider, less proven reliability — fallback to OpenAI is essential

**Fallback: GPT-4o-mini** (standard openai SDK)
- Triggers when: `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is empty/missing
- Cost: $0.15 per 1M input tokens — 10x cheaper than GPT-4o, acceptable fallback
- Purpose: Ensures app works during development even without a DeepSeek subscription

**Provider abstraction rationale:**
- `get_provider(task_type)` returns the right provider — callers never inspect env vars
- `task_type` param is reserved for Phase 2: route cheap tasks (categorize) to DeepSeek,
  complex tasks (behavioral coaching) to GPT-4o if needed
- Abstract base class `LLMProvider` with `complete()` + `categorize()` methods
  enforces consistent interface regardless of which model is active

## Folder Structure Rationale

```
backend/app/
├── api/        HTTP layer ONLY — FastAPI routers, request/response models
│               Business logic NEVER enters here. Thin wrapper around services.
├── core/       Config, settings, shared utilities. No DB, no business logic.
├── models/     SQLAlchemy ORM models = database table definitions. No business logic.
├── services/   ALL business logic lives here: LLM calls, PDF parsing, analysis.
│               Services call models. Models never call services.
└── main.py     Entry point: create app, add middleware, register routers, lifespan.

frontend/src/
├── app/        Next.js App Router — pages and layouts. Minimal logic.
├── components/ Reusable UI components. Receive props. Know nothing about API.
└── lib/        API client, utilities. Only place that calls backend HTTP endpoints.
```

Dependency direction (strict): `api → services → models`. Never reverse.

---

## Security Rules

1. **No hardcoded secrets** — environment variables only, always
2. **API key validation**: `len(key) > 0` only — NEVER log, print, or compare key values
3. **Log format**: `"DEEPSEEK_API_KEY: set"` or `"DEEPSEEK_API_KEY: not set"` — nothing else
4. **.env never committed** — `.env.example` with empty values is the committed template
5. **CORS**: explicit `allow_origins=[settings.FRONTEND_URL]` — never wildcard `*` in prod
6. **Input validation**: Pydantic models on all API endpoints — reject malformed requests early

---

## Session Protocol

### Session START (every session, no exceptions):
1. Read CLAUDE.md fully
2. State current phase + last completed task in one sentence
3. Confirm next action before touching any code

### Session END or user says "update CLAUDE.md":
1. Add all completed tasks to Completed section
2. Update Current Status
3. Document every new architectural decision with WHY + alternatives
4. Update "Next Session — Start Here" with exact next step
5. Write in caveman mode: dense, no fluff, maximum information

---

## Context Management Rule

When context reaches ~70% capacity:
1. Stop current task immediately
2. Update CLAUDE.md with everything done this session
3. Tell user: "Context dolmak üzere — yeni session açalım"
4. Write exact prompt user should paste to continue

---

## Completed

### Phase 0 — Skeleton (2026-06-18)
- [x] Full monorepo directory structure created
- [x] `backend/app/core/config.py` — Pydantic BaseSettings, len() security checks
- [x] `backend/app/main.py` — FastAPI app, CORS, lifespan, GET /health
- [x] `backend/app/services/llm_provider.py` — ABC + DeepSeekProvider + OpenAIProvider + get_provider()
- [x] `backend/Dockerfile` — python:3.12-slim, curl, hot reload
- [x] `backend/requirements.txt` — all pinned versions per spec
- [x] `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` — landing page, fetches /health on load, shows status
- [x] `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` — root layout, Inter font, Turkish lang
- [x] `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` — centralized HTTP client

## Current Status

**Phase 0 — COMPLETE.** Monorepo scaffold done. No business logic. System runs end-to-end
with health check only. Docker Compose wires postgres → backend → frontend with health checks.

---

## Next Session — Start Here

**Phase 1 goal:** Database models + PDF upload endpoint + LLM transaction extraction skeleton.

Exact next tasks:
1. `backend/app/models/transaction.py` — SQLAlchemy Transaction model (id, amount, description, category, date, user_id)
2. `backend/app/models/user.py` — User model (id, email, created_at)
3. `backend/app/core/database.py` — async SQLAlchemy engine + session factory
4. `backend/app/api/upload.py` — POST /upload endpoint accepting PDF/CSV, returns job_id
5. `backend/app/services/pdf_parser.py` — pdfplumber extracts raw text from uploaded file
6. Alembic setup for migrations (`alembic init`, first migration)
7. Update main.py to create tables on startup (dev only)

Start prompt for new session:
```
Read CLAUDE.md. Phase 0 complete — skeleton is running. Start Phase 1:
database models (Transaction, User) + async SQLAlchemy setup + POST /upload endpoint skeleton.
Follow all learning mode rules: docstrings with WHAT/WHY/BREAKS IF REMOVED, inline WHY comments.
```

## Junior Engineer Notes

### Why three separate Docker services instead of one monolith?

Each service has a different **failure domain** and **scale axis**:
- Postgres crashes → only DB is affected; backend can restart independently
- Backend needs more CPU for LLM calls → scale backend replicas, not Postgres
- Frontend needs CDN/static hosting → deploy frontend to Vercel, keep backend on a VM
- One service failing shouldn't cascade. Three services = three independent blast radii.

### What is a Docker named volume and why does Postgres need it?

A **named volume** (`postgres_data`) is storage managed by Docker that lives outside any
container. When you run `docker compose down`, containers are destroyed — but named volumes
persist. If Postgres used a bind mount or no volume, all your data would vanish on restart.
Named volumes also perform better than bind mounts on macOS (no file system translation overhead).

### Why does `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` matter?

Docker starts containers in dependency order, but "started" ≠ "ready". Postgres container
starts in milliseconds, but the Postgres process inside takes 3-5 seconds to initialize.
Without `condition: service_healthy`, the backend starts, tries to connect, gets
"connection refused", and crashes. The health check (`pg_isready`) polls until Postgres
actually accepts connections, then Docker starts the backend. Order enforced = no race condition.

### Why is `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` correct even inside Docker?

The frontend JavaScript runs in the **user's browser**, not inside the Docker network.
The browser has no idea what `http://backend:8000` means — that hostname only resolves
inside the Docker network. The browser can reach `http://localhost:8000` because Docker
maps container port 8000 to host port 8000. So the env var uses `localhost`, not `backend`.

### What Phase 1 builds on this foundation

Phase 1 adds the data layer:
- SQLAlchemy models define the database schema
- Alembic migrations version-control schema changes (like git for the DB)
- The upload endpoint gives users a way to submit data
- PDF parser extracts raw text that the LLM will categorize in Phase 2
Everything in Phase 0 (config, CORS, health check, provider abstraction) is infrastructure
Phase 1 builds on without modification.
